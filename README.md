# Fuzu Primary School Academic Management System
Android Jetpack Compose project code for Fuzu Primary School's Academic Management System

## Milestone:
Developed a GUI application using Kotlin. The application connects to a database and performs CRUD operations.

## Main Goal:
Developing a Kotlin application with a GUI that implements Material UI for a primary school called Fuzu.

## Functional Requirements:
The application allows:
- A parent to register his/her child as a student and, be able to login to check the 
exam results that teachers upload.
- A teacher to login and upload student marks for 3 subjects (Mathematics, English, 
Kiswahili).

## Non-functional Requirements:
The application:
- Has a user-friendly GUI for both parents and teachers.
- Does not crash in case a user makes a mistake, instead it provides appropriate clarifications and warnings.

**This project is a re-work of a mini-project assignment that I was given in my first year Object-Oriented Programming I (OOP I) unit.**
